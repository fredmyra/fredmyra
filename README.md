- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @fredmyra

I am looking for a package  which was recommended to me on linuxquestions.org : " So the way I would do it is install Rosegarden from the sbo-current git repo. They have Rosegarden 20.12 which should be fresh enough."
I could not find itg and then I came across a webpage asking me to start an account and now I don=t know what to do here.

I am trying to configure an installation of Slackware (live) DAW  on a few machines ans  I am stillat my first attempt.
I want to add Rosegarden and people told me I will need Li;hypond as a dependency, which is OK with me if I have to. But I have never noticed Lilyhpond in any of the other distros where I have had rosegarden run. 


The point now for me is to find the above mentioned recommended version of Rosdegarden
